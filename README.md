# Movie Recommendation System ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️

A simple web application that recommends movies using Machine Learning, built with React for the front end and Flask for the back end.

## How It Works

1. **User Movie Search**: Users can search for movies.
2. **Watch Trailers**: Users can watch trailers and clips of the movies.
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: If a user watches a movie clip, its details are saved in local storage. The system then recommends similar movies based on that.
4. **Autocomplete Search**: The search bar suggests movie titles as you type.

## Features ⭐️

- Search for movies
- Watch trailers and clips
